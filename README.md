remotenotes (prototype)
===========

__Goal:__ Take quick pictures of your notes with an Android app without caring too much about getting them just right. In the background the pictures are uploaded to a server that runs them through a computer vision pipeline to clean them up. The cleaned notes are viewable inside the app or on a website.
